Coq,Standard Library,coq_library.csv,https://coq.inria.fr/library/index.html,small,"a top level module, such as Init or Arith","Coq's library is small. It resembles that of a standard programming library, containing basic definitions of data types and a few properties about basic algebraic structures such as rings. However, it does have some modules of interest as a mathematician."
Coq,Packages,coq_packages.csv,https://coq.inria.fr/opam/www/,packages,"a package","Coq's package management system has a wide vaiety of packages. A package in Coq's package management system is the natural way of dividing up the packages into modules. However, some packages are very large and cover a large amount of topics."
Isabelle,Core Libraries,isabelle_library.csv,https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/,large,"a session, such as HOL/HOL-Algebra","Isabelle's library sorts itself into three levels, with several different libraries being on the first level, sessions being on the second, and individual theory files being on the third. Most of the modules come from the HOL library, and have support for many constructs that would be useful for a mathematician. The size of the library required us to give it the large size. However, the sizes of Isabelle's modules varies widely, from some being much larger than the size we were aiming for and others being much smaller."
Isabelle,Archive of Formal Proofs,afp_packages.csv,https://www.isa-afp.org/,packages,"a submission","A submission is the natural way of dividing up the Archive of Formal Proofs. A submission is in essense very similar to a package."
ACL2,Community Books,acl2_library.csv,https://github.com/acl2/acl2/tree/master/books,large,"second level files and folders, such as kestrel/bitcoin or data-structures/list-theory.lisp","ACL2 organizes its library into community books"
Agda,Community Libraries,agda_libraries.csv,https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Main/Libraries,packages,"a submission such as AoPA or DTGP","The collection of Agda community libraries are a very informal list of contributions found on the Agda Wiki, where users can add their contribution to a simple dot point list on the page. A single item per module was seen as a natural mapping to a module."
Agda,Standard Library,agda_std_library.csv,https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib,small,"a top level module, such as Data or Algebra","Agda's ""standard library"" is an unofficial standard library for Agda. Although Agda's library was chosen to be small, it is definitely on the larger side of small. Agda was chosen to be a small library because splitting the library by any level lower than the top level would result in a very large amount of tiny modules, such as many modules containing less than 100 lines of code each defining a single data type. As of such, having this library be considered small better represents the size of it, even if it may underrepresent it's scope by defining larger modules."
HOL4,HOL4 Library,hol_library.csv,https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/tree/develop/src,large,"a second level module such as AI/machine_learning or probability/probabilityScript.sml","HOL4's libary has a large amount of variance in module size. With some top level modules being quite large such as probability, whereas others are much smaller than a standard module such as topology. A small library size was chosen as it better approximated ""package sized"" modules. However, the library is nevertheless expansive on some topics."
HOL Light,HOL Light Library,hol_light_library.csv,https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light,large,"a second level module, such as Library/analysis.ml or Multivariate/clifford.ml","HOL Light's library has a wide range of support for different areas of mathematics. A module was chosen to be a single file as the files in HOL Light cover a very large amount of topics, and are frequently above 1500 lines."
Mizar,Mizar Mathematical Library,mizar_library.csv,http://www.mizar.org/library/,package,"a submission, such as abian of aff_2","although Mizar's library is called the ""Mizar Mathematical Library"". The library operates more like a repository of community contributions, and as of such the natural transformation is for one contribution to be a module. This however, is slightly misrepresentative, as a community contribution in Mizar is much smaller than the target of 1500 ""package sized"" module."
Metamath,Metamath Library,mm_library.csv,http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html,small,"a ""part"", such as ""ZF SET THEORY"", or one of the smaller theories, such as ""Higher Order Logic""","One ""Part"" has enough metamath code to make up about a ""package sized"" module. It should be noted that there was a minor exception to the standard methodology with Metamath. Metamath has several libraries, where the main library was split up as if it was a small library. However, there are alternative libraries that were so small that each one contributes about the size of a single module. As of such, these were included as single modules."
PVS,NASA PVS Library of Formal Developments,pvs_library.csv,https://github.com/nasa/pvslib,packages,"a module, such as algebra or analysis","PVS's library has a collection of modules which formed the natural mapping to modules. Many of these are relevant more to computer science than mathametics."
Lean,Lean Mathematical Library,lean_library.csv,https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html,large,"a second level module, such as algebra.algebra or probability.distribution","Lean's library is possibly the biggest library in this analysis. This library was therefore considered large, as it best approximates a ""packaged size"" module. However, the sizes of these modules are relatively inconsistent, with some modules being much larger and others being much smaller."
